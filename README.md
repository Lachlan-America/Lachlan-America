ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Lachlan America

I'm an early-career Software Engineer with a Mechatronics background, passionate about building systems that are efficient, scalable, and user-focused.
I enjoy working across the stack, from frontend interfaces to backend logic to system-level problem solving. Iâ€™m always improving how I approach clean architecture and maintainable code.
